# Project rules

- Data access uses the browser Cloud client with RLS restricted to `has_role(auth.uid(),'admin')`; the first account to sign in becomes the only coordinator via `claim_admin()` — keeps the app single-coordinator without a manual setup step.
- Selecciones and clubes live in separate tables with separate membership tables; both reference a single `deportistas` table — avoids duplicating personal data while keeping the modules independent.
- Age is never stored; it is computed from `fecha_nacimiento` in `src/lib/edad.ts` — stays correct over time.
- Sample rows carry `es_ejemplo = true` so they can be wiped with one action without touching real data.
- All app data is loaded once via `useDatos()` (`src/lib/db.ts`) and filtered client-side — dataset is small and it keeps filters instant.
